# Regression-Repo
 # Overview
Welcome to the Regression Algorithms Repository! This repository contains implementations of various regression algorithms. Each folder within this repository contains code, datasets, and other necessary files for different regression techniques.
# Algorithms Included
This repository includes the following regression algorithms:<br>
- Simple linear Regression<br>
- Polynomial Regression <br>
- Multiple Linear Regression <br>
- Decision Tree Regression <br>
- Random Forest Regression <br>

# Getting Started
To get started with this repository, follow these steps:
1) Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/dikshasinghhh/regression-algorithms.git
cd regression-algorithms
```
2) Navigate to the desired algorithm folder:
```
cd Simple_Linear_Regression
```
3) Install required dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4) open jupyter notebook
```
jupyter notebook Simple_Linear_Regression.ipynb
```
<br>

# Usage
To use the algorithms in this repository:
<br>
1. Prepare the Dataset: <br>
Ensure the dataset.csv file is present in the folder of the algorithm you want to run.<br>
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook: <br>
Open the Jupyter Notebook file (algorithm_name.ipynb) and execute the cells to see the implementation and results.<br>
3. Analyze the Results: <br>
Review the output within the Jupyter Notebook to understand the performance and analysis of the algorithm on the provided dataset.<br>
